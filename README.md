# Rue ·ö±
Rue (·ö±) is a cryptocurrency token on the Ethereum network that empowers services within the Rue Network.

# Rue Network
The Rue Network is a series of services designed with the goal of making it simple for anyone to build, deploy and maintain smart contracts and dApps without needing to know how to code.

These elements consist of:

* "The Rue Framework" - a client (RueClient) and WordPress plugin (RuePress) that enable the development of dApps in WordPress.
* "The Rue Chain" - A zero-cost PoA Ethereum sidechain built on Hyperledger Besu that enables private, high-speed, Ethereum compatible transactions. Designed for short-term use until ETH2.0 provides stable scaling and private transactions natively.
* "Ruebase" - A social network built using the Rue Framework that acts as a decentralized identity layer, and built in ad-network. Users can manage how different sites access their information from within Ruebase and webmasters can plugin monetization and login controls directly into their dApp.
* "The Rue Foundation (DAO) - A decentralized autonomous organization aimed at maintaining Rue's ecosystem long term and supporting free and open source development within the dApp ecosystem.

# What is the goal of Rue?
We want to build open source tools that bring web 3.0 to the masses, the same way that WordPress has democratized access to building a website.

We believe the best way to achieve that, to start, is to bake right into WordPress as most users are already familiar with its ecosystem.

# Why is it called Rue?
Rue is the french word for 'road' or 'street' - and when you consider the history of roads they stand as a fascinating testimant to what humanity can achieve.

Roads are one of the largest and oldest public infastructure systems in the world. All of us need roads, they connect us and make our lives easier - but, none of us could really afford to build and maintain our own roads, and we wouldn't find the same benefit to society. In fact, roads are a great example of a Nash Equilibrium from game theory - wherein, if each player is making a decision that is both to the best interest of themselves and the other players within a game, then we have found an equilibrium where no player has anything to gain by changing their strategy.

I could build my own private road and charge you for access, but, then you would do the same, and some people would be unable to access any roads at all which in turn would result in a negative impact on both our social lives and the accessibility of commerce.

It is in the best interest of all parties that roads exist, be maintained, be a collective operation and be freely accessible to all people.

This is true of roads, and it is true of the internet and assoicated technologies.

For example, WordPress became the popular blogging platform that it is today because it is free and accessible.

We believe that the same can and should be done for web3 technologies, and so rather than build on properitary stacks, or build complicated coding languages, we at Rue feel we are building roads. A simple, communal, infastructure service that should be freely available and accessible to anyone and aim to benefit humanity collectively rather than being overly optimized to the goals of any one party.

# Why ·ö±?
·ö± is the symbol for Rue and the Rue token (·ö±1). It comes from the Elder Fu√æark alphabet used by early Germanic Tribes somewhere between the 2nd and 8th centuries. The langauges stemming from Elder Fu√æark translated the rune to Raid≈ç (Proto-Germanic), RƒÅd (Anglo-Saxon), Rei√∞ (Old Icelandic) and êçÇ/raida (Gothic) as the symbol means "to ride" or "a journey".

From classic rune poems, we see that the ·ö± rune is used not to mean a local trip or a joy-ride, but, instead a journey, usually done with others, the kind of journey that is long and winding but worthy of writing down sagas about. It's a journey with purpose.

We thought there was no better possible pairing when it came to symbols to represent Rue. Not only is Rue named for the surfaces on which most modern journies take place, but, we know that the journey to deliver Rue will be a long one filled with plenty of challenges, but, if we're successful in that collective journey it will result in something beautiful for everyone.
